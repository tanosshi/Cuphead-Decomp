# Cuphead Decomp 🚧

### Game Version 2019/05/02, Unity 2023.1.20f

### Made in Unity 2023.1.20f

Cuphead is a classic run and gun action game heavily focused on boss battles. Inspired by cartoons of the 1930s, the visuals and audio are painstakingly created with the same techniques of the era, i.e. traditional hand drawn cel animation, watercolor backgrounds, and original jazz recordings.
